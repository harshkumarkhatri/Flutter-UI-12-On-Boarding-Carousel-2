**About the UI**:-<br>
On boarding UI are the UI's which you must probably be knowing as the carousel screens. When you open the app you are given a gist of what the app has for you with the help of certain screens which are changes as you scroll them or when a specific button is clicked.<br>
This UI has a similar thing. When the last screen is reached the circular button and the dot indicators are replaced by a long button.
